# Experiment 2

## Description
The goal of this experiment is to try to reproduce the results from the paper [Using Deep Learning Neural Networks and Candlestick Chart Representation to Predict Stock Market](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.12258)
on US stocks. (We will train on an order of magnitude bigger dataset, and try more complex models.)
## Hypothesis
We should get similar results to them. They got 92% accuracy at predicting whether the next day will go up or down from 
the current close. This being said, because we train on a bigger dataset, we should get better results. However, the US
stock market is more liquid, which could make prediction harder, but more profitable. (We'll see how it goes).
